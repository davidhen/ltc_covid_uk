# Introduction

1st attempt to combine data from all 4 UK nations to look at excess deaths in 2020 by week and location of death. The main idea of this file is to show co-authors what we are hoping to get as an output. This may not be possible. As you will see here, the data for E & W is combined and we don't have NI data yet. 

## Packages

R packages required.....

# England data

Data provided sourced from [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/datasets/deathregistrationsandoccurrencesbylocalauthorityandhealthboard) and [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/11826fiveyearaverageweeklydeathsbylocalauthorityandplaceofoccurrenceenglandandwalesdeathsregistered2015to2019) and collated into `.csv` files by Pietro. I have saved this file in the `excess_mort_data` folder.

```{r}
england <- read_csv(here("excess_mort_data/Weekly Summary England.csv"))

england %<>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  select(location,
         week_number = `week number`,
         all = `all deaths`,
         non_covid, covid, 
         average = `average 2015-2019`,
         excess = `excess deaths`, 
         country) %>% 
  mutate(location = factor(location,
                           levels = c("Hospital", "Care Home", "Home", "Other"),
                           labels = c("Hospital", "Care Home", "Home", "Other"))) %>% 
  mutate_at(.vars = c("week_number", "all", "covid"), as.integer)

# Scotland data

This comes from two files on the NRS site. One has weekly COIVD and all-cause deaths, the other the weekly numbers (including averages) for the previous 5 years.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
